Practical motivation: According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), as of 2021, approximately 537 million adults (aged 20-79) worldwide are living with diabetes. This number is expected to rise to 643 million by 2030. The prevalence of diabetes has been steadily increasing globally, making it a significant public health concern. Diabetes is a prevalent and serious health condition with long-term implications for individuals and healthcare systems. Accurately predicting the likelihood of diabetes can facilitate early intervention, personalized treatment plans, and improved health outcomes.

Problem formulation: 
Our team aims to analyze a dataset to identify the most accurate predictor of diabetes diagnosis. We want to determine which variable or combination of variables is most effective in predicting diabetes diagnosis accurately.
